<h2>Decoupage</h2>
<p>
&nbsp Decoupage or d√©coupage is the art of decorating an object by gluing colored paper cutouts onto it in 
combination with special paint effects, gold leaf and other decorative elements.<br> Commonly, 
an object like a small box or an item of furniture is covered by cutouts from magazines or
from purpose-manufactured papers. Each layer is sealed with varnishes (often multiple coats)
until the "stuck on" appearance disappears and the result looks like painting or inlay work.
The traditional technique used 30 to 40 layers of varnish which were then sanded to a polished finish.
</p>

<h2>Glass Painting</h2>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp Glass painting is one of the most attractive art form with innumerable techniques followed.
    Glass painting gives the presence of a fairy-tale. It is also been referred to as a glass art 
    or stained glass. Glass art amplifies its beauty when the light passes through it. Painting is
   been a mode of expression and creativity. Glass is one of the best mediums which can be used in
    contemporary and abstract art. The usage of glass in a painting as a base like a canvas for 
    painting is majorly transformed and developed from the time it has existed in style, purpose
   and technique.
